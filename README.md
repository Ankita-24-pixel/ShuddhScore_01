    - To manage Flutter versions easily, download and install **FVM (Flutter Version Management)**:
        - Install FVM by following the [official FVM installation guide](https://fvm.app/documentation/getting-started/installation).
        - Once FVM is installed, run the following commands to set Flutter to version 3.44.8:

We have predefined run configurations for Android Studio and Visual Studio Code.
In order to run the application, make sure you are in the `packages/smooth_app` directory and run these commands:

- `fvm flutter pub get .`
- On Android 🤖: `fvm flutter run -t lib/entrypoints/android/main_google_play.dart`
- On iOS/macOS 🍎: `fvm flutter run -t lib/entrypoints/ios/main_ios.dart`
- Troubleshooting: If you encounter dependency resolution errors, try:
